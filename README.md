CoffeeShop Management System
The "My Coffee Shop" program that I developed is an exceptionally functional way of managing a coffee shop. This software offers a range of advanced features aimed at optimizing the daily tasks associated with order management.

The application provides a user-friendly way to manage the menu and orders, leveraging the capabilities of receipts. Users can add, edit, or remove products, while also comfortably managing quantities, thereby assisting in the efficient service of customers.

Furthermore, users have the ability to monitor sales, adjust prices, and receive reports on the performance of their business, using receipts as a tool.

In summary, we can describe "My Coffee Shop" as an advanced coffee shop management system that provides all the necessary functions for accurate payment calculations and effective recording of sold products.
